## Question

Two particles P and Q have mass 0.6 kg and 0.2 kg respectively. The particles are attached to the ends of a light inextensible string. The string passes over a small smooth pulley which is fixed above a horizontal floor. Both particles are held, with the string taut, at a height of 1m above the floor. The particles are released from rest and in the subsequent motion Q does not reach the pulley.

- a) Find the tension in the string immediately after the particles are released.
- b) Find the acceleration of P immediately alter the particles are released.

When the particles have been moving for 0.4 s, the string breaks.

- c) Find the further time that elapses until P hits the floor.
- d) State how in your calculations you have used the information that the string is inextensible.
